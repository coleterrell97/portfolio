My name is Cole Terrell, and I am a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Kentucky

This is a collection of coding projects in various languages. This is primarily a space for me to store programs that were completed post-graduation in an effort to stay sharp on my programming skills.

I am always seeking to learn new techniques/technologies, so any feedback/leads are greatly appreciated!

My interests are typically in machine learning/AI, embedded systems, and computer networking.
